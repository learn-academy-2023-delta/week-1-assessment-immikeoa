# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

Your answer:

Researched answer:

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: Git is a software designed for version control. GitHub is a  cloud service designed to stored git repository files.

Researched answer: git is a version controlled system used primarilky to track source code during software developement, it helps collaborate. GitHub is a web service that gives developers the option to store git repositories. It also provide its users aadditional services, such as issue tracking, project management tools, collaboration features, and code review capabilities. 

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

Your answer: I am not completely sure but i think the greater than simbol > will output a true or false. It is usally used compare in if/ else statement and while loops that will peform the rest of the code depenpding on true of false value.

Researched answer: There are several operators in javascript would output a boolea, such as Comparison Operators,Strict Comparison Operators, Logical Operators etc...

1. What is the difference between an array's index and its value?

Your answer: An array index is were in the array is the data located fro index 0 until the last item in the array. The value is the data store in that location which it can be a number, strin, another array, object etc...

Researched answer: The index of the array determines its position in the array from 0 to its end. The value will be the data stored in that index. For example it can be a number, string, an array, boolean, or object etc...

4. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer: An array is ordered list of elements that can cotain different type of data. An string can only store a collection caracters.

Researched answer: Both Array and string are order list that its data can be accessed by its index. They are both able to used in a for loop and higher ordered functions. Both data types have a .lenght property. Differences ---> arrays are mutable which its elements can be modified. Arrays can hold different types of data. Arrays are represented with square brackets and commas to separate its different elements ["a",77,"Hello."], strings in the other hand is represented by signle ' ' or doble " " quotes.

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer: Being able to communicate ideas. Asking question to the navigator when helper does not understands. Being able to listen to your partner ideas. The driver is the person coding. The navigator is the one guiding the person coding.

Researched answer: proper pair programming is helpful avoid bugs in the code. It avoids fatigue since the pairs are often switching roles. It give the pair the ability to learn faster while coding and trouble shooting. It helps both programmers to review code since they are spending less time coding.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: They are functions that take other functions as arguments and/or return functions as their results. They the users the ability to reuse functions and keep the code modular.

2. Jest:Jest is a widely-used testing framework for JavaScript applications, including Node.js and React. It offers a comprehensive set of tools for writing, executing, and reporting tests, with support for assertions.

3. Objects: In JavaScript, objects are used to store related data and functions together, making them useful for representing complex entities, modeling real-world concepts, and organizing code. They are a fundamental part of the JavaScript language.

4. Method:In JavaScript, methods are functions that belong to objects. They allow objects to do things or perform tasks. Methods are like actions or behaviors that objects can have.

5. Classes:In JavaScript, classes are like blueprints for creating objects that have similar properties and behaviors. They allow you to define the structure, properties, and methods of objects in a reusable way. Think of classes as templates for creating objects with shared characteristics.
